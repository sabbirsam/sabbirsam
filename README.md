Apart from this, @sabbirsam has a passion for teaching and sharing knowledge which led him to start his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSuyK8ufCNX-eO4WQJ5u5tA) in 2017, where he teaches Programming on Python, Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Android development and currently working on WordPress Theme and Plugin.

To be honest, I love learning and trying to keep up with technology in every way. If I say which specific language I like, then Python the most especially artificial intelligence and later since I am working with PHP (Associated with React), I will put it in 2nd option.
